This document outlines the software and programs used to curate raw, public sequence data

NCBI SRA toolkit - https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software
  fastq-dump is used from this toolkit, to retrieve public sequences from NCBI using SRA run accession numbers.
FastQC - http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
  Used to check the quality of the sequences retrieved from the SRA. 
Cutadapt - http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
  Used to removed primers, adaptors and barcodes from raw sequences, and subsequently filter out short or poor quality sequences.
Galaxy - https://usegalaxy.org/ 
  Used to unite paired reads that were split for primer removal and filtering.
Biopython - https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Used to convert fastq files to fasta files.
IgBlast - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/ 
  Used to annotate filtered sequences against the ncbi database.
IMGT - http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/login.action
  Used to annotate filtered sequences against the imgt database.
MiXCR - http://mixcr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
  Used to annotate T-cell sequences against the mixcr database.
